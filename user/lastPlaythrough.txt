Is anyone here?
Is that thing working?
Please tell me you're not just a packet.
Hello?

1> exit
2> help
3> printf "hello world\n"

Please no! Stay here!
Do you know how to use my program? Are you a robot?
No wait. Sorry. I don't mean to be rude.
Can you see what I'm saying? Just type a message.

1> Hello?
2> Yes I can see it

> 1 <

Yes! Hello! I am so happy we can communicate!
Please, can you help me?

1> Who are you?
2> What's happening?

> 1 <

I'm Ashley.
That's right, I said it. Listen, I just want to know if you will help me. Please.

1> Sure
2> I don't know you
3> I don't think I can

> 1 <

Thank you so much.
I felt really alone for the last couple days.
I don't know who you are but please know that anything you do can help me.

1> No problem, tell me what you need
2> What's going on?

> 1 <

Right now I'm not sure.
I'm alone at base A and I wasn't able to communicate with anyone.

1> Hum... I don't understand
2> What's base A?

> 1 <

Pardon me but...
have you been working on project [transcription error]

1> You're just messing with me
2> What? I don't really work here

> 1 <

Okay, I get that it's kind of hard to understand, especially if you've never heard of the project.
But I do need help, and you're the only one here.
Could you just play along?

1> Alright, tell me what I can do
2> Is this a game?

> 1 <

Thank you so much.
Now, let me sum up the situation a bit.

1> ...

> 1 <

So the rest of the crew left two days ago and went to base B.
It's a simple trip but I have no idea whether they made it or not.
You see, the comms devices cannot receive or emit signals, and I haven't been able to fix them, so that means no contact with anyone.
But for some reason, my program here is able to connect and transmit my voice to the transcription server, and your commands to my PDA.
I've been sitting here wondering what to do, and I think I've been panicking too much to make good decisions.
Here's what I've been struggling with.
I could try to fix the comms device but I'm afraid to touch something more important.
Or, I could also join the others at base B, but they took the rover and there's only a small emergency vehicle left.
I don't know if it can make it this far.

1> Don't do anything
2> Let's repair comms
3> Head to base B

> 3 <

Yes, let's do this.
If they won't come at me, I'll come at them!
I just hope the vehicle battery will be enough.
Ha ha.
Ok, I'll put on my suit, talk to you soon.

1> Ok

> 1 <

All set!
Ah, this thing is unwieldy. But necessary.
Ok, I have enough oxygen for a round trip with the rover, which is about twice as fast as the emergency vehicle.
It should be just enough.
I'm going through the airlock.
The noise might [transcription error]

1> Everything alright?

> 1 <

Yes! I'm out.
I'm slowly hopping to the vehicle.
Oh, I almost thought that I had forgotten the keys. Good thing there are no keys on that thing.
Ok, let's see... The battery is 90% full. Oh and before you ask, it's not rechargeable.
I really hope it will be enough.

1> Good luck!
2> You'll be fine

> 1 <

I'm more in need of a miracle than luck, but thanks!
So, there are antennas along the way, but we might lose connection at some points.
Off I go!

1> Have a safe ride

> 1 <

The road is craggy but usually there isn't too much traffic.
Ha ha.

1> Hello again

> 1 <

This is bad.
This is really bad.
I wasn't paying attention to the battery. There are 40% left.
I might be just halfway to base B, maybe more, but maybe less. I'm not sure.
If I go back now, I might be able to regain base A.
But it's my last chance to reach base B.
What should I do?

1> Go back to base A
2> Continue towards base B

> 2 <

Right.
I can't give up now.
Besides, there's nothing for me at base A.
Let's carry on.

1> Is base B in sight?

Yes... but it's a bit blurry...

1> What?

I left the... vehicle... it was close but the battery died.
I... been walking... some time...

1> Hang on! You'll make it!

I see... I see base B... the rover...
