Is anyone here?
Is that thing working?
Please tell me you're not just a packet.
Hello?

3> printf "hello world\n"

Please no! Stay here!
Do you know how to use my program? Are you a robot?
No wait. Sorry. I don't mean to be rude.
Can you see what I'm saying? Just type a message.

1> Hello?
2> Yes I can see it

> 1 <

Yes! Hello! I am so happy we can communicate!
Please, can you help me?

1> Who are you?
2> What's happening?

> 1 <

I'm Ashley.
That's right, I said it. Listen, I just want to know if you will help me. Please.

1> Sure
2> I don't know you
3> I don't think I can

> 1 <

Thank you so much.
I felt really alone for the last couple days.
I don't know who you are but please know that anything you do can help me.

1> No problem, tell me what you need
2> What's going on?

> 1 <

Right now I'm not sure.
I'm alone at base A and I wasn't able to communicate with anyone.

1> Hum... I don't understand
2> What's base A?

> 1 <

Pardon me but...
have you been working on project [transcription error]

1> You're just messing with me
2> What? I don't really work here

> 1 <

Okay, I get that it's kind of hard to understand, especially if you've never heard of the project.
But I do need help, and you're the only one here.
Could you just play along?

1> Alright, tell me what I can do
2> Is this a game?

> 1 <

Thank you so much.
Now, let me sum up the situation a bit.

1> ...

> 1 <

So the rest of the crew left two days ago and went to base B.
It's a simple trip but I have no idea whether they made it or not.
You see, the comms devices cannot receive or emit signals, and I haven't been able to fix them, so that means no contact with anyone.
But for some reason, my program here is able to connect and transmit my voice to the transcription server, and your commands to my PDA.
I've been sitting here wondering what to do, and I think I've been panicking too much to make good decisions.
Here's what I've been struggling with.
I could try to fix the comms device but I'm afraid to touch something more important.
Or, I could also join the others at base B, but they took the rover and there's only a small emergency vehicle left.
I don't know if it can make it this far.

1> Don't do anything
2> Let's repair comms
3> Head to base B

> 2 <

Ok! That souds good. I'm safe here. As long as I don't break anything.
So I've already taken a look and I found the switch cabinet linked to the transmitters.
The thing is, everything looks fine: LEDs are green, cables are plugged, even the digital display says OK!
I can't diagnose the problem here.

1> Hit it hard
2> Find the main switch, turn it off and back on
3> Look somewhere else

> 1 <

That's... old school.
But then again, devices are aren't the most recent.
Take that!
KBJHSD[transcription error]

1> What happened?

> 1 <

Nothing.
Oh yeah, the transcription shouldn't process sounds that aren't voices, but if it's too loud it can lose it sometimes.
Anyway, nothing has changed and comms are still down.

1> Hit it harder
2> Find the main switch, turn it off and back on
3> Look somewhere else

> 1 <

I'm not sure this is the right way to go but I'm going to trust you.
Here it comes!
PPKSF[transcription error]

1> So?

> 1 <

Same result.
I think I should try something else.

1> SMASH THAT THING like your life depends on it
2> Find the main switch, turn it off and back on
3> Look somewhere else

> 1 <

I hope you're telling me that because you know it can fix it.
Not because you're laughing at the idea of me alone in the base and banging my arm against the wall.
Ok, that does sound funny.
Whatever.
YAAAA[transcription error]BGBGKJSHHGD[transcription error]

1> ...

> 1 <

It's still the same.
However, the door of another cabinet on the side just fell on me.
If it wasn't for lunar gravity, that door would have hurt.
But guess what, I have good news: there's an extra battery for the emergency vehicle in there.
With that, I'm pretty confident I can make it to base B.

1> Let's do that, then!
2> You don't have to thank me

> 1 <

Yes!
Finally, I'm feeling enthusiastic, and a bit less terrified about this situation.
Thank you!
I'm going to hop into my suit.
This will take a while.

1> Alright

> 1 <

Ready to go!
Ah, those suits aren't the most comfortable but I like that they keep me alive.
So! Oxygen, check. Extra battery, check.
I'm going through the airlock!
[transcription error]

1> All good?

> 1 <

I'm out!
I'm making my way to the vehicle...
Well well well, the battery has 90% left.
Maybe the other one won't be needed but at least I know I'm safe.
Let's go!

1> Drive safe!

> 1 <

It's fine.
Though having a traffic accident would be a nice thing: It would mean I'm not alone here...
Speaking of alone, the connection might drop at times.
The antennas on the way are pretty far apart.

1> Ok

What a beautiful road. Kind of jagged but

Hi there.
I think I'm close now.
Oh, and I switched batteries!
You really saved me there.
I'll pretend the discovery of this extra battery was carefully planned, and not a random

Base B in sight!
I can see the rover.
So the rest of the crew must still be there. Those bastards could have come to check up on me.
I bet they're not expecting me now...
Actually, I kind of fear what their reaction will be.
What do you think?

1> Get there and face them
2> Be discreet and try to sneak in

> 2 <

That sounds smart.
They shouldn't have seen me yet.
I'll leave the vehicle in this crater here, and walk around in order to arrive from behind where there are no windows.

1> Good plan

> 1 <

I'm really nervous again.
Ok, let's walk.
This will take a while...

1> Don't get caught!

> 1 <

I'm being as stealthy as a leopard chasing its prey.
Well, as much as a spacesuit can allow.

1> ...

> 1 <



1> ...

> 1 <

Okay, I'm behind the building!
On the left, I can reach the entrance airlock.
On the right, there is... nothing much.
Just a few footprints, but they might be older than the base.

1> Go left to the entrance
2> Follow the footprints on the right

> 1 <

Sure... why not.
I mean, if someone went over there recently, there might be something interesting.

1> Yes

> 1 <

Mmh. Just plain walls.
At least there are no windows for them to see me...
Oh?
HOLY[transcription error]

1> What's happening?

> 1 <

SOMEONE IS OUTSIDE!
They've seen me! They're coming to me!
Who is it?
Ah, stupid vacuum, I can't just speak to them!
What do I do?

1> Freeze, no sudden movements!
2> Have you heard of the semaphore alphabet?
3> Run!

> 2 <

Ah!
Arms to the left! H!
Up right! E!
How's the letter L?
I'm panicking! What do I say?
And what is that thing in their hanDZJZKJDZZ[transcription error]
