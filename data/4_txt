Base B in sight!
I can see the rover.
So the rest of the crew must still be there. Those bastards could have come to check up on me.
I bet they're not expecting me now...
Actually, I kind of fear what their reaction will be.
What do you think?

1> Get there and face them
2> Be discreet and try to sneak in

*
&1
Ha ha, yes.
We're all adults here.
If they have a problem with me, they're going to say it.
And I definitely have a problem with them leaving me behind!

1> That's the spirit!

*
&2
That sounds smart.
They shouldn't have seen me yet.
I'll leave the vehicle in this crater here, and walk around in order to arrive from behind where there are no windows.

1> Good plan

*
&3
They better be ready.
Ok, they should have noticed my vehicle by now.
I'm going to park in front of the main aisle, there's a huge window there.
Oh wait, I think... HEY! I'M COMING, SHITHEADS!

1> Can you see them?

*
&4
I'm really nervous again.
Ok, let's walk.
This will take a while...

1> Don't get caught!

*
&5
Yes! They're in the lobby!
I see Ellen, Calvin... wait, what are they...
What!? They're leaving the lobby!
COME BACK! I KNOW YOU CAN'T HEAR ME BUT YOU CAN SEE ME!
Dammit!
Where do I go?

1> The entrance airlock
2> The window

*
&6
I'm being as stealthy as a leopard chasing its prey.
Well, as much as a spacesuit can allow.

1> ...

*
&7
What the hell?
They've triggered the emergency lock?
I can't enter!
No! This is so messed up. What have I done?
What do I do now?
I don't have enough battery or oxygen to go back!

1> Smash the door
2> Go to the window

*
&8


1> ...

*
&9
Okay, I'm not sure what would kill everyone first.
Pressure change, temperature, the escape of oxygen...
but I'm not murdering anyone here.
So I'll just say that while I have been able to break a cabinet door, two airlock doors remain stronger than me.

1> Ok, check the window

*
&10
Okay, I'm behind the building!
On the left, I can reach the entrance airlock.
On the right, there is... nothing much.
Just a few footprints, but they might be older than the base.

1> Follow the footprints on the right
2> Go left to the entrance

*
&11
Ok! On my way...
So, I can see inside the lobby... it's empty.
They all left.
Is that coffee on the table?
They were safe and warm while I was alone at base A!
And who is... wait.
AAAAAAAAAAA[transcription error]

1> What??

*
&12
Sure... why not.
I mean, if someone went over there recently, there might be something interesting.

1> Yes

*
&13
Mmh. Just plain walls.
At least there are no windows for them to see me...
Oh?
HOLY[transcription error]

1> What's happening?

*
&14
SOMEONE IS OUTSIDE!
They've seen me! They're coming to me!
Who is it?
Ah, stupid vacuum, I can't just speak to them!
What do I do?

1> Freeze, no sudden movements!
2> Have you heard of the semaphore alphabet?
3> Run!

*
&15
Ok! Come here. I really can't see their face... Wait, what are they holdiNZGNZGZGNN[transcription error]

1> What's happening?

*
&16
Ah!
Arms to the left! H!
Up right! E!
How's the letter L?
I'm panicking! What do I say?
And what is that thing in their hanDZJZKJDZZ[transcription error]

1> What's going on?

*
&17
Yes!
I'm running!
[transcription error]
Aaaah, faster!
Screw that suit!
Screw lunar gravity!
I think they're getting closerRRGRZHRH[transcription error]

1> Find something to protect you and cut them
2> Don't touch anything, just look
3> There's no need and no time for protection, cut them
