Is anyone here?
Is that thing working?
Please tell me you're not just a packet.
Hello?

1> exit
2> help
3> printf "hello world\n"

*
&1
Please no! Stay here!
Do you know how to use my program? Are you a robot?
No wait. Sorry. I don't mean to be rude.
Can you see what I'm saying? Just type a message.

1> Hello?
2> Yes I can see it

*
&2
Yes! Help! I need help!
Did you just type that? I can't believe it actually works.
Please, will you help me? Can you type a reply?

1> Am I talking to a person?
2> What do you need?

*
&3
Wait. What is this? I'm sorry I'm really not in the mood for jokes right now.
Whoever you are: you are my only hope.
Are you there?

1> Yes, I think?
2> What do you need?

*
&4
Yes! Hello! I am so happy we can communicate!
Please, can you help me?

1> Who are you?
2> What's happening?

*
&5
This is a miracle!
Ok, there are so many things I want to ask. But the most important is: can you help me?

1> I have questions too
2> I guess? What do you need?

*
&6
Yes! You are!
If my program works correctly, you should see a transcription of my voice. And I can see what you're writing.

1> Who am I talking to?
2> So what's wrong?

*
&7
You definitely are!
I mean, despite the mind-boggling distance between us, I'm really happy we can talk. Can you help me?

1> Sure
2> Did you track my location?

*
&8
Actually I'm not really sure.
I went over the panic stage and at this point I'm confident I have very little chances of surviving, but since you're here maybe we can work together!
Please?

1> I want to help you, what's going on?
2> You just sound fishy to me
3> I'm sorry I don't think I can be of any help

*
&9
I'm Ashley.
That's right, I said it. Listen, I just want to know if you will help me. Please.

1> Sure
2> I don't know you
3> I don't think I can

*
&10
Ok ok ok please forgive me.
I'm not thinking clear here.
Go ahead, ask me what you want.

1> Who are you?
2> What is this program?

*
&11
It's me. It's Ashley.
Yeah, I'm still here. Probably not for long.
Unless you agree to help me!

1> I can help you
2> I'm sorry but I don't know you

*
&12
Thank you. Really.
I'm in deep stress right now so pardon me if I sound a bit harsh.
Voice transcription isn't the best at forwarding emotion.

1> So what do you need?
2> What's wrong?

*
&13
Thank you so much.
I felt really alone for the last couple days.
I don't know who you are but please know that anything you do can help me.

1> No problem, tell me what you need
2> What's going on?

*
&14
I'm Ashley. Grand.
Yeah, you found me. I won't try to hide.
So now that you know that, will you help me?

1> I've never heard of you
2> Why would you hide?

*
&15
It's... a side project.
Listen, do I know you at the agency? I really need to trust you.
I know I'm in trouble for a lot of things, including my program here, but without it I might as well be dead.

1> What are you talking about?
2> Are you trying to track me?

*
&16
Oh. So you're... an outsider?
How did you... No wait, I don't want to know.
Actually, I'm glad I'm speaking with a third-party here.
Hell, maybe you're one of my superiors and you're trying to manipulate me, but who cares, it's not like I can ask for someone else's help.

1> I want to help you
2> What are you in trouble for?

*
&17
It's me, Ashley.
You know what happened, right?

1> No, I just happened to be on the network
2> Oh yeah, the famous Ashley Grand

*
&18
Right now I'm not sure.
I'm alone at base A and I wasn't able to communicate with anyone.

1> Hum... I don't understand
2> What's base A?

*
&19
I've messed with the wrong people.
And yet I went on that mission. What a fool I am...

1> Are you ok?
2> You don't sound very smart indeed

*
&20
No! Don't be afraid.
I'm the one in trouble here.
I don't know who you are, I mean no harm, I just want to know if you can help me.

1> What are you in trouble for?
2> I'm not supposed to be in the network

*
&21
Pardon me but...
have you been working on project [transcription error]

1> You're just messing with me
2> What? I don't really work here

*
&22
Hey, I don't really care what you think of me or what I've done.
I'm just stuck on this rock and I'm going to die.
Plain and simple.
So if this was part of the plan, you didn't have to come to laugh at me.
However if you don't hate me, I'd appreciate a little help.

1> Are you alright?
2> I will help you

*
&23
You mean, in general, or right now?
Because right now might be the important part here.

1> Right now. Are you ok?
2> In general

*
&24
Okay, I get that it's kind of hard to understand, especially if you've never heard of the project.
But I do need help, and you're the only one here.
Could you just play along?

1> Alright, tell me what I can do
2> Is this a game?

*
&25
To be honest, I might be at the worst moment of my life. But that's positive, right? It means it can only get better. And it starts with you!

1> Let me help you

*
&26
To be honest, I might be at the worst moment of my life. But that's positive, right? It means it can only get better. And it starts with you!

1> Let me help you

*
&27
You know how is it.
I'm chilling 380 000 kilometers away and my oxygen supply won't last forever.
Let alone water and food.

1> WHAT
2> Wait, you're in space?

*
&28
Hold on. Don't worry.
I don't want to know how you got here.
On the contrary, I'm grateful someone was able to find my program and run it.
That's why I made it.

1> Did "something go wrong"?
2> So how can I help?

*
&29
All that matters is that you found my program and that we can communicate. So are you willing to help me? I really need you.

1> Ok, tell me what happened
2> I don't think I can

*
&30
Oh well, so many things went wrong.
From my opinion about the mission's objective to how comms magically don't work anymore.

1> How can I help?
2> I still don't understand

*
&31
Hey, of course you can.
Simply being able to talk to someone actually helps.
I might need more than that, but will you stay with me?

1> Okay
2> What is going on?

*
&32
Thank you so much.
Now, let me sum up the situation a bit.

1> ...

*
&33
As I suspected, the mission is a failure and I'm alone at base A.
But icing on the cake: no one tried to contact me and I can't even emit a distress signal to the others or to Eart.
Thank you so much for coming.

1> What mission?
2> Wait, you're not on Earth?

*
&34
Ha ha! So you really aren't from the agency.
You know what? It's actually the best help I could get.
They got me into this mess, and I'm pretty sure they weren't going to hep me out of it.

1> What's the current situation?

*
&35
I'M STUCK MDR
