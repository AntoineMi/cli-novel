Here's the entrance.
There's no way they won't notice me once I equalize the pressure, but at least I'll be inside.

1> Let's do this

*
&1
Outside pressure reached!
Ok, first door, I'm in.
Now to equalize again... [transcription error]

1> Are you done?

*
&2
I'm inside!
And... no one's here? Despite all the noise I've been making?
That's strange...
I'll take my suit off and see where they are.

1> Right

*
&3
Done!
Erm, is this a joke?
The door to the lobby won't open?
When did... wait.
There's a strange noise.

1> A strange noise?
2> Try forcing the door

*
&4
Yes, like a whistle... Hey, I think it's coming from the vents... Oh no, are they messing with... the oxygen!?

1> Try forcing the door
2> Look for the ventilation control circuit

*
&5
Ngggggggggggh!
It's airtight. No matter how hard I... push or pull!

1> Look for the door control circuit
2> Force harder!

*
&6
Ok!
There are plenty of electrical cabinets here!
They're all.. identical...
Except for one with a DANGER sign... and one with a SYSTEM sign

1> Open a random cabinet
2> Open the "DANGER" cabinet
3> Open the "SYSTEM" cabinet

*
&7
NNNNNGGGG[transcription error]
I... it's no use, I... phew... this is tiring...

1> DESTROY THE DOOR
2> Look for the door control circuit

*
&8
Alright then!
This one will do!
It's... it's hard to breathe.
Where do I start? There are... switches everywhere...

1> Turn them all on!
2> Turn them all off!
3> Switch things at random!

*
&9
There are wires everywhere!
Ah... I need some fresh air.
Anyway.
They're connected through screw terminals...
Red and green... green and blue, blue and orange, orange and black... black and red...
What do I do... here?

1> Find some gloves first
2> Remove the red-green terminal
3> Remove the green-blue terminal
4> Remove the blue-orange terminal
5> Remove the orange-black terminal
6> Remove the black-red terminal

*
&10
TAKE THAT... STUPID... DOOR...
I [transcription error]

1> Are you ok?

*
&11
There's a... computer inside.
Just a second, I'm catching my breath...
Ok! It's a terminal.
What do I... type?

1> "door open"
2> "fix this shit"
3> "help"
4> "printf "hello world\n""

*
&12
Yes the... electric...
Ah... It really feels...

1> What's going on?

*
&13
There! There... there!
There... ok I... it's on...
But I still... ah...

1> Try another cabinet!

*
&14
Yes... good idea you have there...
Ok, there are gloves inside the door...
Oh, they're still warm.
So... what do I do?

1> Remove the red-green terminal
2> Remove the green-blue terminal
3> Remove the blue-orange terminal
4> Remove the orange-black terminal
5> Remove the black-red terminal

*
&15
Off! Off! You too, off!
Everyone... off...
Ok... they're off... off...

1> Try another cabinet!

*
&16
Ok, come here you...
SCKKCSKKJJ[transcription error]

1> Everything ok?

*
&17
Ok, come here you...
SCKKCSKKJJ[transcription error]

&18

I think I'm...

1> Try something else!

*
&20
Ok, come here you...
SCKKCSKKJJ[transcription error]

1> Everything ok?

*
&21
Ok, come here you...
SCKKCSKKJJ[transcription error]

1> Everything ok?

*
&22
Yeah... probably... wait...
Unknown command...

1> Try something else!

*
&23
Ok, come here you...
SCKKCSKKJJ[transcription error]

1> Everything ok?

*
&24
So there's... a list of... commands...
I could try...

1> Keep going!

*
&25
[transcription error] oxygen... [transcription error]

1> Hey!

*
&26
Why did I... type this...
Ha... ha...
It says...
Hello... world...

1> Try something else!

*
&27
And... ok.
I cut the wires... around it...
But i think the noise... is... still...

1> Try another screw terminal!

*
&28
And... ok.
I cut the wires... around it...
But i think the noise... is... still...

1> Try another screw terminal!

*
&29
And... ok.
I cut the wires... around it...
But i think the noise... is... still...

1> Try another screw terminal!

*
&30
Good... I... removed it.
Wait... I think the noise is gone...
Yes! AH!
Let me take some deep breaths!

1> Well done!

*
&31
And... ok.
I cut the wires... around it...
But i think the noise... is... still...

1> Try another screw terminal!

*
&32
It must be the oxygen controller for the room...
In theory, it can only be adjusted physically.
But I'm sure they messed with the connector to access it remotely.
And they did it a few minutes ago.
That's why the gloves were still warm.

1> They tried to kill you

*
&33
Yes... yes...
[transcription error]

1> Be strong!
