Here's what I've been struggling with.
I could try to fix the comms device but I'm afraid to touch something more important.
Or, I could also join the others at base B, but they took the rover and there's only a small emergency vehicle left.
I don't know if it can make it this far.

1> Don't do anything
2> Let's repair comms
3> Head to base B

*
&1
Eh, it sounded like the smart choice two days ago.
But now I'm really starting to feel like I need to move on.

1> You're right, let's fix comms
2> No trust me, it's the best thing to do
3> Yes, go to base B

*
&2
Ok! That souds good. I'm safe here. As long as I don't break anything.
So I've already taken a look and I found the switch cabinet linked to the transmitters.
The thing is, everything looks fine: LEDs are green, cables are plugged, even the digital display says OK!
I can't diagnose the problem here.

1> Hit it hard
2> Find the main switch, turn it off and back on
3> Look somewhere else

*
&3
That's... old school.
But then again, devices are aren't the most recent.
Take that!
KBJHSD[transcription error]

1> What happened?

*
&4
Nothing.
Oh yeah, the transcription shouldn't process sounds that aren't voices, but if it's too loud it can lose it sometimes.
Anyway, nothing has changed and comms are still down.

1> Hit it harder
2> Find the main switch, turn it off and back on
3> Look somewhere else

*
&5
I'm not sure this is the right way to go but I'm going to trust you.
Here it comes!
PPKSF[transcription error]

1> So?

*
&6
Same result.
I think I should try something else.

1> SMASH THAT THING like your life depends on it
2> Find the main switch, turn it off and back on
3> Look somewhere else

*
&7
I hope you're telling me that because you know it can fix it.
Not because you're laughing at the idea of me alone in the base and banging my arm against the wall.
Ok, that does sound funny.
Whatever.

*

Yeah, maybe... If this alone fixes it, please don't mock me.
It's not my fault if their comms are as stable as a Windows environment.
Let's see

1> Hello?

*
&10
It's still the same.
However, the door of another cabinet on the side just fell on me.
If it wasn't for lunar gravity, that door would have hurt.
But guess what, I have good news: there's an extra battery for the emergency vehicle in there.
With that, I'm pretty confident I can make it to base B.

1> Let's do that, then!
2> You don't have to thank me

*
&11
GOD you scared me!
I'm glad I set my program to automatically reconnect.

1> So is it working?

*
&12
Yes!
Finally, I'm feeling enthusiastic, and a bit less terrified about this situation.
Thank you!
I'm going to hop into my suit.
This will take a while.

1> Alright

*
&13
Ha ha, you know, I really appreciate what you're doing for me.
I'm happy I can trust you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to wear my suit if I want to survive outside.

1> Okay

*
&14
Nope.
I wasn't sure we'd get disconnected.
I mean, we're able to communicate and yet the base cannot detect or emit a signal.
It's as if we were bypassing some sort of barrier.
What is wrong here? 

1> Look somewhere else
2> Screw comms, go to base B

*
&15
Ready to go!
Ah, those suits aren't the most comfortable but I like that they keep me alive.
So! Oxygen, check. Extra battery, check.
I'm going through the airlock!
[transcription error]

1> All good?

*
&16
I'm out!
I'm making my way to the vehicle...
Well well well, the battery has 90% left.
Maybe the other one won't be needed but at least I know I'm safe.
Let's go!

1> Drive safe!

*
&17
Right, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
So, there's the control desk from which I tried to emit signals.
And there's also another cabinet with a bright DANGER sign on it.

1> Go to the control desk
2> Go to the cabinet

*
&18
You're making me do things I wouldn't do on my own.
Maybe that will save me.
Maybe not. We'll see.
So, what do we have here?
Wires, screw terminals... One of the screws looks different though, it looks like it was added after the others.

1> What's special about it?
2> Remove it

*
&19
It's fine.
Though having a traffic accident would be a nice thing: It would mean I'm not alone here...
Speaking of alone, the connection might drop at times.
The antennas on the way are pretty far apart.

1> Ok

*
&20
I can't really do that.
I need to cut the wires.
And also, I probably need electrical protection gloves.
You don't mess with electricity.

1> Find something to protect you and cut them
2> Don't touch anything, just look
3> There's no need and no time for protection, cut them

*
&21
What a beautiful road. Kind of jagged but

Alright you seem confident about this.
Wait a minute, I'll see if I can get my hands on some gloves.
Or rather, in some gloves. Ha.

1> ...

*
&23
Let's see... it looks more new.
And it's the only one that connects black and orange wires.
There are many different color combinations but black-orange only appears once.

1> Go to the control desk
2> Go to base B

*
&24
I'm not sure that's the brightest idea. But as I said, I'm screwed.
So I'm going to trust you there.
I REALLY hope you know what you're talking about.
Let me grab a knife... and KJJ[transcription error]

1> Everything alright?

&26
I've tried pretty much everything, from the computer or directly with the emitter-receiver.

1> Check the computer again

&27
I found a pair!
Now, time to cut this off.
And... done.
Now... wait, what is that noise?

1> How is it going?

*
&29
Ok, give me a minute... Yeah, nothing new.
It's a pretty basic system, you can't do much besides opening communications and taking notes.

1> Are there some notes?
2> Just go to base B

*
&30
I'm familiar with that big box, we use it all the time.
And nothing looks wrong about it.
Let me unplug and replug everything again...

1> So how is it going?

*
&31
It's some kind of... whistle... As if...

1> As if?

*
&32
Right. I'll get to the control desk... I just need...

1> Yes?

*
&33
Everything fine.
I still have a long way

&34
I've checked already.
Some guy was complaining the emergency vehicle couldn't reach base B with its small battery, which is why I'm afraid to go.
And someone else added: "One battery is just enough, quit whining".
Sometimes I wonder how we made it to space with such a team.

1> You probably should stay here
2> I think you should try base B

*
&35
Technically, perfectly fine.
But in practice I still can't EMIT or RECEIVE, which kinda defeats the purpose of this EMITTER-RECEIVER, am I right?
This is making me crazy.

1> You need some rest
2> I'd give up on comms and go to base B

*
&36
As if air... was being... sucked off... the room...

1> Are you ok?

*
&37
I... my head is... heavy...

1> What's going on?

*
&38


1> ...

*
&39
Alright, alright.
I probably can't make rational choices here.
You must be the voice of reason.
I'll just wait and... wait.

1> Good, you're safe here

And if they don't... you're the only rescue I could get.

1> Why wouldn't they rescue you?

*
&48
Great idea!
So, is there something you'd like to talk about?

1> Tell me about this program
2> Tell me about what "went wrong"

Hi there.
I think I'm close now.
Oh, and I switched batteries!
You really saved me there.
I'll pretend the discovery of this extra battery was carefully planned, and not a random

It's a small tool I wrote as an auxiliary means of communication.
Basically, it captures the data from my microphone and transcripts it to text.
On your end, you type something and it shows up on my PDA here.
I kind of violated the agency policy because it goes through an unmonitored protocol, but at least it works.

1> Tell me about what "went wrong"


*
&52


1> ...

*
&53
We have a lot of disagreements about our purpose here.
I've joined the agency in order to act for science and the greater good.
And yet they only want to serve their personal interests.
I almost threw my hand in the face of Clarence.

1> What's the mission?
2> Clarence sounds like a cunt

*
&54
We're collecting data on the lunar surface to build a solar farm.
The bases and laboratories here need more power, but they want to sell the energy for private corporations to settle on the planet.

1> What? Space business?

*
&55
Oh yeah, he is.
But he's also my superior, and I bet he has something to do with my extended holidays here.

1> Waiting for help isn't the best idea then
2> You should stay here, it's safer

*
&56
Yeah. That's the future.
You might not have heard about it but it's definitely coming soon.
Thanks to greedy and corrupt men like my superiors.
The more I think about it, the clearer it seems that they were trying to get rid of me.

1> Waiting for help isn't the best idea then
2> You should stay here, it's safer

*
&57
You're right.
Even if I could send a distress signal, I doubt they'd raise a finger to help me.
So what's left?

1> Base B!

*
&58
Right... damn. I'm really stuck here.
And I'm exhausted.
I've been running around for too long, so sitting here and talking made me realize I should settle and relax.

1> Good idea

*
&59
I might doze off a little... stay connected, I'll reach you again soon.

1> Ok!

*
&60
Yes, let's do this.
If they won't come at me, I'll come at them!
I just hope the vehicle battery will be enough.
Ha ha.
Ok, I'll put on my suit, talk to you soon.

1> Ok

*
&61
All set!
Ah, this thing is unwieldy. But necessary.
Ok, I have enough oxygen for a round trip with the rover, which is about twice as fast as the emergency vehicle.
It should be just enough.
I'm going through the airlock.
The noise might [transcription error]

&63
Yes! I'm out.
I'm slowly hopping to the vehicle.
Oh, I almost thought that I had forgotten the keys. Good thing there are no keys on that thing.
Ok, let's see... The battery is 90% full. Oh and before you ask, it's not rechargeable.
I really hope it will be enough.

1> Good luck!
2> You'll be fine

*
&64


1> ...

*
&65
I'm more in need of a miracle than luck, but thanks!
So, there are antennas along the way, but we might lose connection at some points.
Off I go!

1> Have a safe ride

*
&66
Thank you again for accompanying me through this.
Base B, I'm on my way!
Oh, we might lose connection on the road sometimes.
The antennas don't have a very good range.

1> Have a safe ride

&67
Why am I feeling more tired than... before?
How long... as it been?

1> A bit more than an hour

This is bad.
This is really bad.
I wasn't paying attention to the battery. There are 40% left.
I might be just halfway to base B, maybe more, but maybe less. I'm not sure.
If I go back now, I might be able to regain base A.
But it's my last chance to reach base B.
What should I do?

1> Go back to base A
2> Continue towards base B

*
&80
Ok. Gah, I'm so mad I wasted all this time and battery.
But it's better than not reaching base B and having to walk.
I wouldn't have enough oxygen.
